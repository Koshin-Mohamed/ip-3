## Description

This website's purpose is to provide the visitor with a visual representation of Delani Studios portfolio and services as well as collect their information.

## BDD

When the user clicks the icon in the banner it moves down the page to the service section.

In the service section the 3 sections of design, development, and management are clickable and toggle upon click to reveal more information.

Additionally, when the user mouse hovers over the portfolio images a text overlay of the project appears.

Lastly, the form collects the user info (name, e-mail and message) and give them a confirmation and thank you that we have received their info and will contact them.

The MailChimp API is integrated on the site through the form so that all collected information is sent to the site's account creating a database of the users and future clients.
